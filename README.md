## Description

The README generator allows users to skip the frustrating process of creating a proper and in depth README to allow future users, developers, and employers go through and understand what the projectâ€™s goal is. It not only does that but cuts lots of time wasted for rookie developers in order to allows them to focus on their proper coding techniques.

## Installation

To install this application utilize an IDE I personally use VsCode. You will also need to install Nodejs version 18 or later which is found on the node website. As well as go to the npm docs for inquirer package and you will later install it in the integrated terminal with your VsCode as needed to allow proper usage.

## Usage

If you have all of the requirements needed to run the project ESPECIALLY nodejs go ahead and open the integrated terminal and run it using node index.js. This will pull your prompts up and then answer them accordingly for your specific project. This will then generate a new README.md for you.
